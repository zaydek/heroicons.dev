## Contributing Guide

Contributions are welcome! I’m actively maintaining this website.

[heroicons.dev](https://heroicons.dev) is built on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [Splitbee](https://splitbee.io) for analytics. If you plan on contributing, the only thing you need to know is before you can build the development server, you need to run `yarn tailwind-dev` to build the Tailwind configuration file. `yarn tailwind-build` is the command for building the Tailwind configuration file for production (you probably don’t need to use this one).

That’s pretty much it. I’m using a [custom ESLint configuration file](https://github.com/zaydek/dot-eslintrc.js) for formatting, but you can ignore this yourself when contributing.

Thank you for contributing!

# Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
